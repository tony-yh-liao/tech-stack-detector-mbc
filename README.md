### Key Components

#### Content Script (`content.js`)
- Performs technology detection on web pages
- Uses multiple validation methods for accuracy
- Returns depth analysis for each detected technology
- Handles edge cases and error scenarios

#### Popup Script (`popup.js`)
- Manages popup UI and user interactions
- Groups technologies by domain
- Implements pagination for large datasets
- Handles logo loading and error fallbacks

#### Background Script (`background.js`)
- Manages communication between content and popup scripts
- Maintains state of detected technologies
- Handles message routing and error handling

### Adding New Technologies

To add a new technology for detection:

1. **Add detection logic in `content.js`**
   ```javascript
   {
     name: "New Technology",
     test: () => {
       const indicators = [];
       
       // Strong indicators
       if (window.newTech) indicators.push('global');
       if (document.querySelector('[data-newtech]')) indicators.push('attributes');
       
       // Script validation
       const scripts = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('script')).filter(s => 
         s.src && s.src.includes('newtech')
       );
       if (scripts.length > 0) indicators.push('script');
       
       return {
         detected: indicators.length >= 2,
         depth: indicators.length,
         indicators: indicators
       };
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Add logo in `popup.js`**
   ```javascript
   const techLogos = {
     // ... existing logos
     "New Technology": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/newtech/newtech-original.svg"
   };
   ```

3. **Add to appropriate group in `popup.js`**
   ```javascript
   const techGroups = {
     "Appropriate Group": ["Existing Tech", "New Technology"]
   };
   ```

4. **Write tests in `tests/content.test.js`**
   ```javascript
   test('New Technology detection should work correctly', () => {
     // Test implementation
   });
   ```

   - Check that Jest is properly configured
   - Verify test environment setup

3. **Performance issues**
   - Check for memory leaks in content script
   - Verify pagination is working correctly
   - Monitor network requests for logo loading

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by adding to `content.js`:
```javascript
console.log('Debug: Technology detection running');
```
